# ML Practice
A place to learn and practice machine learning.

## Steps in a Typical Machine Learning Project
1. Look at the problem and create a big picture view.
2. Get the data
3. Explore and visualize the data to gain insights
4. Pre-process the data for machine learning algorithm
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine tune your model
7. Test the solution 
8. Launch, monitor and maintain the system.
